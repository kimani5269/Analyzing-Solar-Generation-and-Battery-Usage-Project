"Eliud Ochieno","March 7, 2025","The app work well to allow access to bank operations. However, it freezes in case it's launched when the internet connection isn't available or there's poor signal coverage to support internet connection when using data. To resolve this the app requires total reboot which doesn't exist in its provisional settings like stopping and restarting it unless overall phone reboot is done. Kindly look into this, I'm experiencing it on Techno Spark device.","169 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","March 13, 2025","Hello Eliud, thank you for reaching out to us.

"derick mwangi","May 17, 2024","Overall, the app is very useful and has great features. However, here are some fixes I recommend: 1. Once one opens up savings accounts and transfers funds into them, the balances keep appearing even after one selects the ""hide balance"" option. This feature keeps resetting each time one interacts with other parts of the app. 2. There is a bug in the current version which prevents the app from exiting once one selects ""I would like to leave"".","107 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","May 17, 2024","Hello Derick, thank you for sharing your experience with us. This is well noted and shared with the relevant team to serve you and our other customers better.

"Wairimu Mwangi","December 13, 2022","Very disappointed. The app started off great then along the way it just wasn't responding, I had to uninstall and re-install it back. Since then I can't get past the security questions even though I know I am putting in the correct answers. And there is no way of getting assistance from the app. What's up with that? Also, when the app was working, I couldn't transfer money to other mpesa numbers except mine and there was no way of deleting those failed transactions and the numbers. DISAPPOINTING","1,047 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","December 14, 2022","Hi Wairimu, we would like to engage you further on your experience and concern.

"Arthur Karanja","March 18, 2024","The App works well but every now and then it crashes. Recently, it wouldn't log in and would state ""unable to proceed please try again later"". Tried logging in several instances on separate occassions but since it was urgent, I uninstalled the app and re-downloaded it again. Now it gets stuck at ""Please check your Internet connection and try again."" Tried via mobile Internet, WiFi..same response.

"Fred Oulu","April 29, 2022","As stated by many, the new registration and login process is both a tiring and annoying procedure. The updated app is effective but very inefficient. A lot of time is wasted logging in , or waiting for OTPs, and it's clearly putting off customers. Thankfully, there is an sms option. The old version worked just fine. This new app needs a serious overhaul.","286 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","May 1, 2022","Hello Fred, we appreciate the review and regret any inconveniences caused.

"Mark Alphy","October 5, 2022","I appreciate the convenience that the app offers. Indeed, I can access my account from the comfort of wherever and even make transactions without a fuss. However, I have an issue with how every time I open the app, it directs me to choose a mode of verification, ALL THE TIME. Unfortunately, it becomes a nuisance because I have to receive an email indicating a 'New sign-in to your profile', EVERY TIME. I hate nuisance and I am convinced I speak for many. Please have that issue resolved.","448 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","October 5, 2022","Hello Mark, thank you for sharing your review.

"Emmanuel Otieno","August 26, 2024","The latest update of this app, from a month or two ago, has a terrible experience. It crashes all the time, transactions end up not completing yet my account is debited, and my phone keeps telling me to put the app to deep sleep as it is affecting my phone's performance with its constant crashes. What's up with that? Customer support have asked me to clear my cache, which I keep doing but it keeps crashing and failing.","112 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","August 27, 2024","Hello Emmanuel, we sincerely apologize that we have brought you any inconvenience.

"Wilbur Omae","January 14, 2022","Three negatives and two positives (in comparison to the previous app by Finserve). Negatives: 1. OTP not sent far too many times causing transactions to fail. 2. Requires a full (8+ characters with numbers and symbols) password to log in everytime in the absence of Touch ID. What about the M-banking pin such as was available in the other app? 3. Broken navigation sometimes when exiting the app. Positives: 1. The statements feature is awesome. 2. Slick UI.","78 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","January 14, 2022","Hello Wilbur, we're glad you like the User Interface and the statements feature. Sure, we might have experienced delays with verification code delivery but we trust this has been addressed. Our sincere apologies. For the password, we have made it more complex for security reasons. Could you please share more details on the issue of signing out?"
"chacha","March 9, 2022","The UI is amazing. The UX however needs a lot of improvement. As a user I would like to complete transactions with the fewest clicks possible. The Eazy Banking did that really effectively. for this version, just to send money to MPesa i need about 12 clicks and that is bad UX. Also, on the app landing page, you show the balances only. Maybe you can move these transact options from a tab to a button on the landing page for ease in transactions and to reduce the clicks like the Eazy Banking did.","873 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","March 9, 2022","Hello there, thank you for taking your time to write to us.

"Charles Kyangu","September 29, 2022","This app is good in terms of interface, ease of use, and retrieval of statements. The security is also good. But the security prompt should be at the end and not at the beginning of a transaction. If someone (unauthorized user) got/ snatched the gadget during a transaction, they can transfer funds as much as they want since the user had logged in. If that is amended, the app will be excellent.","1,528 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","September 30, 2022","Hi Charles, thank you for engaging us.

"Jotham","October 29, 2023","This App has been good until the recently released update. I am very disappointed that I can no longer use the App for secure transactions. Using two different Android phones, versions 6.0.1 and 5.1.1, one phone shows a big Equity splash screen then closes up, the other won't accept the verification code stating an error. Re-installing App didn't help. I can login hassle-free via web on PC. Also, please enable direct deposit in-App to PayPal. This is a very important feature lacking in the App.","3,317 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","October 29, 2023","Hello Jotham, we are sorry for the challenge experienced with the App.

"Nicholas Wamalwa Omondi","June 2, 2022","After careful analysis, I realized you need to activate the application using mobile data. Once you do so, you won't get any problems. The upgrade is good because it links all accounts under your national identification number. For security reasons, you can't transfer funds directly if the phone number linked with your account is not in the same phone.","395 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","June 2, 2022","Hello Nicholas.

I thought it was a temporary glitch, but the problem still persists. I have also noticed that the app forces my phone to restart when left on the black screen. It is absolutely ridiculous and scaring.

"Dennis Fidha","May 4, 2022","1. Everytime I successfully log in I have to select 2 security questions and answer them, the app also takes me to a place where I have to delete one of my previous login sessions, what's up with that? it's annoying. 2. There are simply too many clicks to get anything done. I feel like there should atleast be a shortcut button that leads you straight to your transactions i.e transfer to another account or to MPESA. The landing page should also show your transaction history like eazzyApp","174 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","May 4, 2022","Hello Dennis, thank you for taking time to review our App.

"Charles Ivia","August 29, 2022","Works well for most use cases. I however find the following issues curious. 1. There are multiple ways of authorizing a transfer- pin or OTP. A customer should be able to select which option they prefer and not deal with the current unpredictability. 2. I am unable to enter an OTP to authorize a transaction if I have my simacard in a different phone. This is poor UX. Let me enter the OTP manually if that's what I want. Basically, a customer should have a choice.","297 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","August 30, 2022","Hi Charles, thanks for taking the time to review us.

The app completely stopped working after the most recent update, making it useless for financial transactions. The user interface is poorly designed, making basic functions difficult to use.

Nothing is working out. You can't send any money from your account to your mobile through this app, it tells to add accounts then it says ""all accounts added""!, Then it switches back to the beginning and nothing works.

Each time I try to sign in after signing out, I have to wait for a call in 48 hours to continue with the process instead of just sending an OTP. Worst is that they may fail to call.

I've now given it 3 ð and will monitor it and hopefully be back soon so I can rate it 5 Stars Prior: Unbelievably Bad. Crashes all the time. Need to reinstall at least once a week. Our fees pay for this poor programming. How can we believe our money is safe with Equity Bank when their app is so unstable??? Thanks for your reply. I will give you details on the coming days.","22 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","July 17, 2022","Thank you for getting back to us, Stem.

"Thomas Katairo","June 12, 2022","I tried this app because the usual Equity app failed to work on my phone, but now I prefer this one. The interface looks better and more user friendly. I am giving you 3 stars because, this app doesnot allow cardless withdraws from ATM, its only through agents. With the previous app, withdrawing cardless was cheaper and I wouldnt worry moving with my ATM. If you change that, then you will get your 5 stars.","3 people found this review helpful","Equity Group","June 28, 2022","Hello Thomas, thank you for taking your time to write to us.

The downloadable version 0.00 autofill on the say debit side if the transaction was a credit makes it hard for me to reconcile (too many numbers). Why can't the debit side be just blank if the entry is a credit and vice versa? Can u allow OTP via email.
